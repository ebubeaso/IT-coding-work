This Flask project that I have started on uses SQLite as a database to store
and manage data. I wanted to take my Flask skills to the next level by even
using some of my web development skills to make a simple Flask web application
that will take in user input or allow people to make API calls from the
application itself without having to use Python Requests or an API dev tool
like Postman.
