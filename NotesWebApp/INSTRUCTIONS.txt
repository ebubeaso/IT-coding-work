This is a set of instructions that will help you get my notes web application
to run smoothly on your computer. Since it is a web application, it needs to be
run on a web server. This set of instructions will allow you to setup the web
server on your machine to use. Without the web server, you won't be able to use
this web application.

Here are the steps to set it up on your Windows computer:

1.) Run the Python web installer to install Python (it is needed to run the
web server, it is VERY IMPORTANT!!!!)
   - When the Python installer pops up, you need to check the checkbox that says
"Add Python 3.9 to PATH" -> Doing this will allow you to run Python from the
command line on Windows. Once you click that checkbox, click Install Now and
install Python.

2.) Now you have Python, yayyy!! Next, click on the Python script that says 
"installServerDependencies.py" -> this automatically installs the
additional software needed to run the server without any problems.

3.) Click on the Python file that says "notes_server.py" -> Run this Python
script anytime you want to start up the web server to access the notes app.

***************************************************************************
HURRAY!! You have now installed my notes application and you can use it
whenever you like. To stop the web server, click on the command line window
and press Ctrl + C to stop the server. You can start it back up by clicking
the file "notes_server.py" to run the server again to access the notes web
application.
