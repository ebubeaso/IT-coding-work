This is a set of instructions that will help you get my notes web application
to run smoothly on your computer. Since it is a web application, it needs to be
run on a web server. This set of instructions will allow you to setup the web
server on your machine to use. Without the web server, you won't be able to use
this web application.

Here are the steps to set it up on your Windows computer:

1.) Run the Python installer to install Python (it is needed to run the
web server, it is VERY IMPORTANT!!!!)
   - When the Python installer pops up, click on "Continue" until you see the
agreement popup. Once you see the popup, click "Agree" and then you will see
the Install button. Click the install button to install Python.

2.) Now you have Python, yayyy!! Next, open up the Terminal application by 
searching for the Terminal app on your Mac. You will use the terminal to add 
in the dependencies (extra components) to run the small Python web server
(and yes, you get to feel like a computer whiz too!!). On the Terminal, type
in the command "cd Desktop/NotesWebApp" and press enter. This command changes
the current location of the Terminal to inside the NotesWebApp folder that 
you saved on in your Desktop ("cd" is short for "change directory", which is
telling your Mac to change the current folder that the Terminal is in to be in
another folder).

3. Next, type in the command "python3 webServerDependencies.py" into the 
Terminal -> this automatically installs the additional software needed to run 
the server without any problems.

4.) Once that finishes, type in the terminal "python3 notes_server.py" -> You 
would need to run this command in the terminal anytime you want to start up 
the web server to access the notes app.

***************************************************************************

HURRAY!! You have now installed my notes application and you can use it
whenever you like. To stop the web server, click on the command line window
and press Ctrl + C to stop the server. You can start it back up by following 
the steps listed in step 4 to run the web server on your computer. If you want 
to get back on this notes application but you have closed the Terminal 
application on your Mac, start up the Terminal application, run the command
"cd Desktop/NotesWebApp" to move into the folder of the notes web app, and then 
type in "python3 notes_server.py" since this is the command that starts up the
web server with the notes application.
