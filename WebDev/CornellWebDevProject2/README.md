This is another website project that I have worked on while I was in Cornell. This was also
done about two years ago for my Web Development class. It is more involved than my first web
project, where it uses JavaScript and jQuery to add some interactivity to the website. It also
has a form page that a user can go through to input information. I decided to add this as well
as another reference for me to look back at as I make additional website projects to build up
on my web development skills. It is a lot more fun to do now that I am not doing these types
of projects for a letter grade, I am doing them to improve my IT and programming skills.
