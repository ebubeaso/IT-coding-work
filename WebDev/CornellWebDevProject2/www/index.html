  <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p>
    Hello! My name is <strong>Ebube Aso</strong> and this is my first website! Here, you will find some information about me as well as what to expect from here. I enjoyed putting this together and I hope you enjoy my work too!
    </p>
  <h2>Why Did I Make This?</h2>
    <p>
    The main purpose of this page is to help inspire other young dancers to continue to work on their craft and showcase it to the world. Being a dancer or an artist in general can be <em>really difficult</em>. It requires taking the time to always perfect your craft and gain enough confidence to showcase your work publically for other people to judge you. It can be very discouraging at the beginning when people may criticize you. In fact, that's what makes a lot of people hesitant from investing in their art. However, I would like to showcase my work as a dancer for other young dancer to see; it will be a good way to continue to inspire them to do what they love regardless of what other people think.

      <strong><em>Through dance, the space around me is my canvas, my body is the paintbrush and the music is the paint. With these components I am capable of creating my unique form of visual art to showcase to the world! Whether I inspire one person or a multitude of people, it will be an honor to have my dance perspective mean a lot to another dancer working on their craft.</em></strong>
