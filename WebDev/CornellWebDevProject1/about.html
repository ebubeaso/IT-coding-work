    <p>
    Born and raised from <em>Providence, Rhode Island</em>, I started learning about dance during my junior year back in high school. I wanted to do something special for prom, so I decided to learn how to dance (I was the only member in my family who could not dance at the time). From there, I taught myself some basic grooves and footwork to learning different types of hip hop dance styles including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Popping</li>
      <li>Waving</li>
      <li>Tutting</li>
      <li>Breaking/B-boy</li>
      <li>Rocking/Footwork</li>
    </ul>

    <p> I have also incorporated other styles including dancehall, salsa, house, and tricking to create my unique style as a well-rounded dancer. Every day I look for ways to improve; I continue on improving my body control, learn new movements, and even make variations of the different moves I have learned. However, dance isn't only about moves. I practice listening to music and move along with it, ensuring that I capture the feelings emanating from the song.

      <strong><em>Through dance, the space around me is my canvas, my body is the paintbrush and the music is the paint. With these components I am capable of creating my unique form of visual art to showcase to the world! Whether I inspire one person or a multitude of people, it will be an honor to have my dance perspective mean a lot to another dancer working on their craft.</em></strong>
