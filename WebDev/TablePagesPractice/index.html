    <h1>Hello There!</h1>
    <h2>Why I made this practice webpage:</h2>
    <p>I made this webpage because I wanted to get some practice into making
    tables using HTML after rereading my web development book. As much as I
    can read the textbook, it will be better to learn by doing, where I start
    off with the HTML first, and then move my way to styling it with the CSS.
    Once that is done, I will add in JavaScript to make it more dynamic.
    </p>
    <p>This will point to two other webpages: The first page will have a 
        record of the number of <strong>Totally Rad Hoodies</strong> hoodies 
        line, and the second will be a 7-day record of the weather.
