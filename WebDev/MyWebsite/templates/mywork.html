                This page is dedicated to showcase the different IT projects that I have completed in my free time. Below are 
                photos and videos that demonstrate my skills and understanding of different technologies in IT. I have 
                categorized my projects into four sections: computer networking, web/full stack development, DevOps and 
                Software Defined Networking, or SDN for short. I made sure to put a lot of effort into these projects. 
                Scroll down to look at some of the various IT projects that I done!
