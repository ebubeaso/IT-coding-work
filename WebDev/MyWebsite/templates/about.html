    <h1 class="title">About Me</h1>
        <p class="paragraph">Born and raised in Providence, Rhode Island, I feel like I have came a long way. I went to Cornell
            University, but I had to withdraw after my junior year due to not having enough money to continue attending. However, 
            I refused to let that stop me and decided to make my own path. I am very ambitious and I love to pave a way to success 
            even when it seems impossible to do so. Have I also mentioned that I am super passionate about technology? Yeah, I am a big tech nerd, 
            especially when it comes to subjects pertaining to Information Technology, which is better known as IT.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">Ever since I got my first computer in middle school I was intrigued with how computers work. I would try 
            out different ways that I could optimize my laptop to perform better, remain in pristine condition and keep it secure. However, it was 
            not until the summer of 2018 that I decided to get my first IT certification: CompTIA Network+. Then, I proceeded to 
            acquire my first AWS certification the following summer, which is the Solutions Architect certification below, and then my Linux+ certification 
            during the summer of 2020. Now, I currently work on strengthening my skills in IT and programming through a variety of personal projects as well 
            as continuing to acquire more IT certifications gradually. Feel free to check out some of my various projects by visiting the 
            <a class="redirect" href="{{url_for('mywork')}}">My Work</a> page. 
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">Here are some more fun facts about me: My favorite color is silver and I am also a freestyle urban dancer. I have 
            been dancing since high school, and I have been self taught during my free time. When I do not have my face in front of a computer, 
            or when I need a break from the stresses in life, I take the time to dance. I use dance as a creative outlet to free my mind and to keep 
            myself moving during the day. Furthermore, I think Linux is better than Windows and I can speak French <i>(Vous ne vous attendiez cela pas, hein?)</i> 
            Enough about me, you can learn more about me by connecting with me on the <a class="redirect" href="{{url_for('contact')}}">Contact</a> page. 
            From there you can send me an email and connect with me via LinkedIn or Instagram after sending me an email (that is where I have my dance videos).
