    <p class="paragraph">Hello! My name is Ebube Aso and I am very passionate about technology.
        I love it so much, that I decided to make my own website from scratch to showcase some 
        of the work that I have done over the past few years. Feel free to look around and see 
        some of my various technical feats and projects. If you would like to get to know a little more 
        about me, visit the <a class="redirect" href="{{url_for('about')}}">About Me</a> page. In 
        addition, you can go to the <a class="redirect" href="{{url_for('mywork')}}">My Work</a> page 
        to see the various project demos that I have uploaded. I plan on taking my IT skills to the next 
        level and doing big things with my accumulation of practical skills and knowledge!
