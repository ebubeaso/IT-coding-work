This is a set of instructions that will help you get my notes web application
to run smoothly on your computer. Since it is a web application, it needs to be
run on a web server. This set of instructions will allow you to setup the web
server on your machine to use. Without the web server, you won't be able to use
this web application.

Here are the steps to set it up on your Windows computer:

1.) Run the Python web installer to install Python (it is needed to run the
web server, it is VERY IMPORTANT!!!!)
   - When the Python installer pops up, you need to check the checkbox that says
"Add Python 3.9 to PATH" -> Doing this will allow you to run Python from the
command line on Windows. Once you click that checkbox, click Install Now and
install Python.

2.) Now you have Python, yayyy!! Next, click on the Python script that says 
"webServerDependencies.py" -> this automatically installs the additional 
software needed to run the server without any problems.

3.) Open up the Command Prompt (type 'cmd' in the Windows Search bar) and then in the
Command Prompt type in 'cd Desktop\NotesWebApp'. Then, type 'python notes_server.py' to start up
the web server -> Run this script anytime you want to automatically start up the web server
to access the notes app. Another way that you can run this file named 
"notes_server.py" is to open up the NotesWebApp folder and clicking on the file
called "notes_server.py". This also starts up the web server that has the notes
web application.

***************************************************************************
HURRAY!! You have now installed my notes application and you can use it
whenever you like. To stop the web server, click on the command line window
and press Ctrl + C to stop the server. You can start the server back up by again 
by following Step 3 above.
