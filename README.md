# IT-coding-work

This repository has various coding scripts in Python, Ruby and Bash that I have worked on to better practice my programming skills for IT.
Most of the code here are simple scripts of me applying my skills in different programming languages so that I can be a jack-of-all-trades
in my field. Information Technology is such a great career field and I love it so much!

This will have my work in various folders: I will have a folder for my Bash scripts, a folder for my Python scripts, a folder for my Ruby scripts
and another folder for some web development work. Recently, I have been investing more time into Java and JavaScript/Node.js as well to get more
comfortable with the development aspect of putting together web applications.
