This directory is where I plan on keeping my projects on Node.js. Honestly,
I have started to gain a liking with Node, and I really like how I can set up
a web server and make APIs with using Node.js in the backend. I like the idea
of using both JavaScript in the client and server side, and making API routes
in Node.js I actually like making almost as much as I like using Python Flask
as a web framework. Now my goal is to make web applications that can help with
configuring and managing network devices and servers so I plan on working more
with Node and seeing what I can do with it in the field of IT, as well as
compare it to Python Flask to see which one I really like using more.
