<h1 class="title">About Me</h1>
    <br/>
    <p class="paragraph">Born and raised in Providence, Rhode Island, I feel like I have came a long way. I went to Cornell
        University, but I had to withdraw after my junior year due to not having enough money to continue. However, I refused 
        to let that stop me and decided to take my own path. I am very ambitious and I love to make a way when it seems 
        impossible to make a way. Have I also mentioned that I am super passionate about technology? Yeah, I am a big tech nerd, 
        especially for Information Technology.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">Ever since I got my first computer in middle school I was intrigued with how computers work. I would try 
        out different ways that I could optimize my laptop to perform better and remain at its pristine condition. However, it was 
        not until the summer of 2018 that I decided to get my first IT certification: CompTIA Network+. From there, I proceeded to 
        acquire my first AWS certification (The Solutions Architect one) and my Linux+. Now, I currently work on strengthening my 
        skills in IT and programming through a variety of personal projects. Feel free to check some of them out in the <b>My Work</b> 
        page. 
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">Here are some more fun facts: My favorite color is silver and I am also a freestyle urban dancer. I have 
        been dancing since high school, and I have been self taught ever since. When I do not have my face in front of a computer,
        I take the time to dance as a creative outlet and keep myself moving. In addition, I think Linux is better than Windows and 
        I can speak French <i>(Vous ne vous attendez cela, hein?)</i> Enough about me, you can learn more about me by connecting with 
        me on the <b>Contact</b> page, where you can send me an email or connect with me on my LinkedIn or my Instagram (that is where 
        I have my dance videos).
