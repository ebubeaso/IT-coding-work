## Milestone 1

Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class. You can use bullet points and lists, or full paragraphs, or a combo, whichever is appropriate. The writing should be solid draft quality but doesn't have to be fancy.

### Target Audience (Milestone 1)

[My target audience for my website are other dancers and people who are into dancing.]

### Feel and Features (Milestone 1)

[I will feature photos and videos as well as inspirational messages that will help inspire people who go on the page.]

### Final Content (Milestone 1)

[I plan to include videos that I have created in the past to showcase my skills for users to get some inspiration of improving as a dancer. In addition, the videos will be a form of entertainment for those who like to watch dance videos.]


## Milestone 2

Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class.

Each section is probably around 1 reasonably sized paragraph (3-5 sentences).

### Target Audience (Milestone 2)

[My target audience is being more focused on dancers between the ages of 12-28 who grew up being into dance. They are people who are starting to get into dance, have been dancing for a while, or like to watch dance videos. In addition, the audience is predominately focused on people who are into hip hop dance since most of my content revolves around that general style. will also be for other dancers who are looking to work with me in dance videos.]

### Site Theme (Milestone 2)

[My site theme would have to be a bold and artistic theme. Since I am targetting other dancers and people who are mainly into hip hop dance, I wanted a theme that will really stand out to them. Thus, using a robust theme will really catch their attention.]

### Navigation (Milestone 2)

[For site navigation, I added a navigation bar for people to view multiple web pages. I felt as though that would be easier for users to get the content they are looking for without the need to keep scrolling down. On each separate webpage most of the information is upfront so there is very little scrolling needed to be done for the most part.]

### Organization (Milestone 2)

[I wanted to set up my website like this because I feel as though it will be something that would appeal to some people in the dance community. Having a big title will help users know right away what this page will be about, as well as subheadings that give an overview of what is going to be on the webpage. In addition, I made sure to add some pictures on each webpage to make them appear more authentic and engaging for the audience.]


## Milestone 3

Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class.

Remember to focus on the things we can't see just by looking at the site: changes, alternatives considered, processes, and justifications.

Each section is probably around 1 reasonably sized paragraph (3-5 sentences).

### Changes from Milestone 2 (Milestone 3)

[Some changes I have made from milestone 2 involved changing the navigation bar as well as the colors of the text. I wanted to change the navigation bar to be horizontal so it feels more like a website. Plus, I added color to the text to make it a bit creative. Furthermore, I deleted the small image that I had on the top of each webpage since it looked unnecessary to have and I added videos to my "Content" page.]

### Visual Design (Milestone 3)

[I thought about my visual design by first wanting to have a cool color for the background instead of warm so the pages don't pop out too much for the reader. In addition, I decided to make the fonts a little bigger and changed the colors of the text to make them more readable to the audience. One key strength about my designs is that they are easy to read without having too much bright colors coming at the user, but it appears to lack some vitality for the background.]

### Emotion (Milestone 3)

[In my designs, I was reaching for a more robust emotion to portray in my webpages. This was the reason why I went to make the headers bold and have a shadow effect on them so they pop out more to the user. I was thinking about giving my pages a sense of power within them. Since the page was meant to be a place for young dancers to seek inspiration, I wanted to make my content really stand out to them and make the users be interested in my content.

## Final Submission - Rationale

This rationale should be polished writing: one you might submit as a report to a client or boss to help explain the project and convince them you did a good job. You'll be surprised how much writing and communicating you need to do about projects and choices on internships and jobs; practice that here.

It should be a comprehensive, complete story of the project. You might find that each section run several paragraphs (1-3). Sketches can often help tell the story of your design. Screenshots are also useful for describing issues discovered during user testing and how you addressed them. Quotes from your users during testing are also very powerful when explaining your rationale.

Your rationale should be a polished version of the earlier rationales.

### Changes from Milestone 3 (Final Submission)

- I have not made any major changes in design since Milestone 3 since my website has been easy to navigate for my users. They have been able to find what they need to do.

### Audience (Final Submission)

[My audience are any adolescents and young adults who like to dance or are into dancing. It is also made for young dancers who want to get more into dancing but need some motivation or inspiration. In addition, my website is also targeted for any dancers or artists that are looking to collaborate with another dancer for an upcoming project, so showing my content with videos is a great way for people to see my work.]

### Design Goals (Final Submission)

[My goal was to make the website easy to navigate for my users as well as something unique that they would like to see. I wanted to make my website look interesting enough to engage my audience. With one of my testers on my website, he found it really cool and bold with how I designed it. Indeed, it made him want to take a look at the content that my website has to offer. I wanted to keep it simple yet use some contrast in my site to help include that sense of artistic creativity that my website revolves around.]

### Navigation (Final Submission)

[It appears that my navigation has met my goal of making it easy to use. Another one of my testers for my website found it fairly easy to navigate. She was able to find information about me, my content, and how to contact me by simply clicking on the links that lead to each webpage with the right information. She was able to find what she needed as fast as possible without needing to think or scroll for a long time on my page.]

### Organization (Final Submission)

[My final organization met my goals with how I organized my information. If my users need to contact me, there is a page for that. If they want to watch my videos, there is a page that has my content there to look at. Furthermore, if they would like to know more about me, there is a page for that as well. In concerning the structure, I made sure to make my headings and subheadings stand out so the users will know what each section on my different webpages entails in terms of the information that they might be looking for. It is appropriate for my audience since my audience is targeted towards the adolescent/young adult who like to find information as fast as possible. The way that my site is organized is enough to have my audience find what they need.]

### Visual Design (Final Submission)

[An explanation of how the final design met your goals and why its appropriate for your audience(s). The overall design of my website appears to have met my goals of creating an engaging website. The use of contrasting colors that complement each other, like red and blue, helps bring extra style to my page without being too over the top. In addition, the shadow effect on my headings and subheadings help make my page appear interesting enough for other dancers and people who are into dance to want to see what I have to offer. Using bold text and italics also helps emphasize the importance of different pieces of information provided on my website.]
