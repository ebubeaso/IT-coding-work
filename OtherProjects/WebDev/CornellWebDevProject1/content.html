    <p>
    As you may have guessed, I will be posting dance videos on this site. However, here are some specifics that I wanted to get into:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>I will be posting a new video every Monday and Thursday at 8pm.</li>
      <li>Of the two videos I post each week, one will be a <u>choreography</u> to a song of my choice and the other will be a <u>freestyle</u> dancing.
      <li> With each new post I will give insight on what I have been working on as well as give some context about the choreography or the feelings that a song gave me while dancing to it.</li>
      <li>Inspirational messages that can help those who need it.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Some Inspiration</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>September 9, 2018</strong>:<em>Do not give up on a task or skill if it is challenging at first. Treat it like it is another person that you are starting to get to know and invest your time to invest a relationship with what skill you are trying to learn.</em></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong><em>Through dance, the space around me is my canvas, my body is the paintbrush and the music is the paint. With these components I am capable of creating my unique form of visual art to showcase to the world! Whether I inspire one person or a multitude of people, it will be an honor to have my dance perspective mean a lot to another dancer working on their craft.</em></strong>
