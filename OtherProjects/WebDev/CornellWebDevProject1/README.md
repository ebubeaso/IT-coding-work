This is a web development project that I have worked on about two years ago in an Introduction
to Web Development class that I have taken at Cornell. This is the first project that I have
worked on, where I had to make a simple custom website of my own just using HTML and CSS. Even
though this was done about two years ago, this serves as a good template for me to look back 
on as a reference as I make additional custom websites for strengthening my web development
skills.
