This website project was a simple one that really got me into doing web
development. I decided to make a cute web page for my wife as a creative
surprise that I know that she would genuinely enjoy. I did take the time to
learn about P5 in JavaScript so that I could have hearts and moving bubbles
to make the web page more dynamic. When I showed it to my wife she greatly 
appreciated it! Although this is a simple project, it is something that I am 
really proud of.
